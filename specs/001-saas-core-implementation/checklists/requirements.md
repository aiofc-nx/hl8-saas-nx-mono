# Specification Quality Checklist: SAAS Core 核心业务模块实现

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Review Notes**:

- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- ✅ User stories describe business value and user needs
- ✅ No specific technology implementations mentioned in requirements
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Review Notes**:

- ✅ No clarification markers found - all requirements are clear
- ✅ Each functional requirement is specific and testable (e.g., "系统必须支持创建五种租户类型")
- ✅ Success criteria include measurable metrics (e.g., "平台管理员可以在3分钟内完成新租户创建")
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details, focus on user experience
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Edge cases section covers boundary conditions and error scenarios
- ✅ "Out of Scope" section clearly defines boundaries
- ✅ Assumptions and Dependencies sections are comprehensive

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Review Notes**:

- ✅ 40 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-040) all have clear descriptions
- ✅ 7 user stories with priorities (P1-P3) covering all major flows
- ✅ 14 success criteria aligned with user stories and requirements
- ✅ Specification maintains focus on business requirements

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Ready for planning

**Summary**:

- Specification is complete and well-structured
- All requirements are clear, testable, and technology-agnostic
- User stories properly prioritized and independently testable
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- Scope is clearly bounded with dependencies and assumptions documented
- No clarifications needed - ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`

**Recommendations**:

- Proceed to implementation planning phase
- Consider breaking down into smaller iterations if needed
- Ensure development team reviews all assumptions and dependencies
